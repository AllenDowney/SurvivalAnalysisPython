Description:

An assembly of 50 new Philips (India) lamps with the 
rating 40 W, 220 V (AC) was taken and installed in the horizontal 
orientation and uniformly distributed over a lab area 11 m 9 7 m. 

The assembly was monitored at regular intervals of 12 h to
look for failures. The instants of recorded failures were
called tâ€˜ and a total of 32 data points were obtained such
that even the last bulb failed. 

Variables:

i - observation number
h - time in hours since experiment start
f - number of failed lamps at particular time h
K - number of surviving lamps  at particular time h
