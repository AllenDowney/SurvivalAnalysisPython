    "This notebook presents four ways to represent a distribution: PMFs, CDFs, survival functions, and hazard functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These representations are equivalent in the sense that if you are given any of them, you can compute the others.  So you might wonder why we need four ways to represent the same information.  There are two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each representation is useful for computing different values and answering different questions.  In this notebook I'll show you what each representation is good for.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In some cases we can use a sample to compute a PMF, and use the PMF to compute the other representations.  In other cases it is easier to estimate the hazard function and use it to compute the others.\n",
